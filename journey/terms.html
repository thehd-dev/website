    <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All materials provided through the Services — including, but not limited to, software, design elements, fonts,
        music, and other content (collectively, “Materials”) — are owned by us or our licensors and are protected by
        intellectual property laws.</p>
    <p>You may not copy, modify, distribute, publicly display, create derivative works of, or otherwise use any

    <p>Please note that you are responsible for independently verifying that the content you create or upload does not
        infringe upon any third-party intellectual property or other legal rights. You bear full responsibility for this
        content and guarantee its legality, authenticity, and non-infringement.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Responsibilities</h2>

        app for music playback and syncing for that individual platform. If you wish to use our app on another platform,
        you will need to purchase the app from the relevant store. Some additional features may be offered as additional
        in-app purchases to subsidise further development.</p>

    <h2>8. Termination</h2>
    <p>The agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or us as follows. You may end your legal
        agreement with us at any time for any reason by discontinuing your use of our apps. We may cease providing you
        with all or part of our apps and services at any time for any reason, including, but not limited to, if we

    <p>You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use,
        goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, however
        arising, that result from:</p>

        have full effect.</p>
    <p>If you have a dispute with us, both parties should try their best to resolve it through friendly negotiation. If
